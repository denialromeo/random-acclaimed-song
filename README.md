### Random Acclaimed Song

YouTube's Search API has a daily usage limit of 100 requests per day per API key (in practice, I seem to get 97). Since there's 10,000 songs I'd like to go through with 11 API keys, it will take me at least 10 days to write Youtube ID's to an output file.

I guess I'll just have to be patient. I'll get ~1100 new songs to listen to each day, which helps.
