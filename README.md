### Random Acclaimed Song

YouTube's Search API has a daily usage limit of 100 requests per day per API key (in practice, I seem to get 97). Since there's 10,000 songs I'd like to go through with 7 API keys, it will take me at least 15 days to write Youtube ID's to an output file.

I guess I'll just have to be patient. I'll get ~700 new songs to listen to each day, which helps, and I guess I could automate this.

I should probably bail on Google API's for borders-quiz. OpenStreetMap, here I come!

### To-Do

* Set up schtasks to run script with each API key every day so I don't have to.
