### Random Acclaimed Song

YouTube's Search API has a daily usage limit of 100 requests per day. Since there's 10,000 songs I'd like to go through, it will take me 100 days to write Youtube ID's to the file. This is annoying.

Doing this manually is not my idea of a good time, so I guess I'll just have to be patient. I'll get some new songs to listen to each day, which helps, and I guess I could automate this.

I should probably bail on Google API's for borders-quiz. OpenStreetMap, here I come!

### To-Do

* Delete from `to-write` and append to `written` automatically.
* Set up schtasks to run script with each API key every day so I don't have to.
