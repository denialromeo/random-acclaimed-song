### Random Acclaimed Song

YouTube's Search API has a daily usage limit of 100 requests per day per API key. Since there's 10,000 songs I'd like to go through with 4 API keys, it will take me at least 25 days to write Youtube ID's to an output file. This is annoying.

Doing this manually is not my idea of a good time, so I guess I'll just have to be patient. I'll get some new songs to listen to each day, which helps, and I guess I could automate this.

I should probably bail on Google API's for borders-quiz. OpenStreetMap, here I come!

### To-Do

* Delete from `to-write` and append to `written` automatically.
* Set up schtasks to run script with each API key every day so I don't have to.
